# fastfile-demo
demo / proposal repo

## Proposal 
### My Approach / Outline: 
Taking a systematic approach involving several steps including strucuring the project, content inventory etc. 
We need to identify and document ALL content elements(Text, images, links etc.) and create a structured format.
We also need to ensure our project structure is clean and organized.
And we need to organize content in a centralized format I'm assuming.

#### Outline of Steps to Execution: 
1. Analyze the Current Website (Components) 
2. Set Up Next.js Project with TailwindCSS
3. Create Project Structure
4. Create and Configure Components
5. Organize Content in /data Directory
6. Update Pages
7. Deployment with AWS Amplify

### Availability / Timeframe confirmation: 
No issues.
### Examples of similar projects: 
I think this repo setup and initial project start should satisfy that inquiry.

### Developer Notes:
I've already started with the Project structure and Setup as well as the Component Development which are key parts of this effort. I look forward to working together in business in bringing you the desired solution and completing this effort.
